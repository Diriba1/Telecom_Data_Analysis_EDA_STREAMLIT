    "Analyzing basic metrics such as mean, median, and other summary statistics is crucial for gaining insights into the central tendencies and distributions of the dataset. Here's an explanation of some key basic metrics and their importance for achieving the global objective in a telecommunications dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean:\n",
    "Explanation: The mean is the average value of a variable and is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations.\n",
    "Importance: The mean provides a measure of the central tendency of the data. It helps identify the average behavior or value, which can be essential for understanding typical user patterns, average session durations, or average data consumption.\n",
    "2. Median:\n",
    "Explanation: The median is the middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "Importance: The median is less sensitive to extreme values (outliers) than the mean. It's useful for understanding the central location of the data, especially when the distribution is skewed. For instance, it can be used to identify the median session duration, which gives a sense of the typical session length.\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Explanation: The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.\n",
    "Importance: A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data. Understanding the variability is crucial for assessing the consistency or volatility of metrics. For example, a high standard deviation in session duration might indicate a wide range of user behaviors.\n",
    "4. Percentiles (e.g., 25th and 75th):\n",
    "Explanation: Percentiles represent the value below which a given percentage of observations fall.\n",
    "Importance: Percentiles help to understand the distribution of data and identify outliers. For instance, the 25th and 75th percentiles can be used to define the interquartile range (IQR), helping to identify the middle 50% of the data and detect potential outliers.\n",
    "5. Count and Proportion:\n",
    "Explanation: Count represents the number of observations, and proportion indicates the relative frequency of a specific category.\n",
    "Importance: Count and proportion are fundamental for understanding the occurrence of events or categories. For example, counting the number of xDR sessions or the proportion of users with specific behaviors can be crucial for the overall analysis.\n",
    "Importance for the Global Objective:\n",
    "Analyzing these basic metrics is essential for achieving the global objective in a telecommunications dataset. It helps in understanding user behavior, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and making informed decisions. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality of Service (QoS): Mean and median session duration, along with standard deviation, can provide insights into the QoS experienced by users. Anomalies in these metrics might indicate potential issues in network performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Engagement: Mean and median can help identify average user engagement, while percentiles can reveal variations in usage patterns. Understanding these metrics is crucial for enhancing user experience and service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network Optimization: Metrics such as download/upload data means and medians, along with standard deviations, are essential for optimizing network resources and capacity planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly Detection: Standard deviation and percentiles are valuable for identifying outliers or anomalies in the dataset, which may require further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these basic metrics, we can develop a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, identify trends, and make informed decisions to achieve the global objectives related to network performance, user experience, and overall efficiency."

    "Non-graphical univariate analysis involves computing dispersion parameters for each quantitative variable in your dataset. Dispersion measures provide insights into the spread or variability of data. Here are some common dispersion parameters, along with their interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The mean represents the average value of a variable.\n",
    "It is a measure of central tendency.\n",
    "For example, the mean session duration can give an idea of the typical length of user sessions.\n",
    "2. Median:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset.\n",
    "It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.\n",
    "For instance, the median download volume can provide insight into the central value, considering potential extreme values.\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion.\n",
    "A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability.\n",
    "For example, a high standard deviation in the data usage of users might suggest diverse usage patterns.\n",
    "4. Range:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data.\n",
    "For instance, the range of session durations can give an idea of the overall variability in session lengths.\n",
    "5. Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The IQR is the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles.\n",
    "It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "For example, the IQR of download speeds can help identify the variability in the central portion of the speed distribution.\n",
    "6. Coefficient of Variation (CV):\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.\n",
    "It provides a relative measure of variability.\n",
    "For instance, a high CV in session duration indicates high relative variability compared to the mean.\n",
    "7. Skewness:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.\n",
    "A positive skewness indicates a longer tail on the right, while negative skewness indicates a longer tail on the left.\n",
    "For example, skewness in data usage might suggest whether the majority of users have low or high usage patterns.\n",
    "8. Kurtosis:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Kurtosis measures the thickness of the tails of a distribution.\n",
    "It indicates whether the distribution is more or less peaked than a normal distribution.\n",
    "For example, kurtosis in download speed can provide insights into the distribution's tail behavior.\n",
    "9. Quantiles (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles):\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Quantiles help identify values below which a given percentage of observations fall.\n",
    "They are useful for understanding the distribution and identifying outliers.\n",
    "For example, the 25th and 75th percentiles of session duration help characterize the central portion of the distribution.\n",
    "10. Outliers:\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Identify potential outliers using various methods, such as the Z-score or IQR method.\n",
    "Outliers can significantly impact dispersion measures and may require special consideration.\n",
    "For instance, identifying outliers in data usage can help understand unusual user behavior.\n",
    "Overall Interpretation:\n",
    "The dispersion parameters collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the variability and distribution of quantitative variables in your dataset. This information is crucial for making informed decisions, detecting patterns, and identifying potential areas for improvement or further investigation, contributing to the overall objectives of your analysis in the telecommunications domain."
